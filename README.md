# Simple Shell Project
## About
The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. It provides an interface between the user and the kernel and executes programs called commands. For example, if a user enters ls then the shell executes the ls command.

This project, simple_shell, is a custom implementation of a simple UNIX shell as a requirement to complete the first sprint in the ALX - Holberton school 12-month SE program. Taking a minimalistic approach, the following functions have been implemented: access, execve, exit, fork, free, fstat, getline, malloc, perror, signal, stat, wait, write.
